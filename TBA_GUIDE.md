# Technical Business Analyst (TBA) Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for Technical Business Analysts working on the logistics management project. It covers requirements clarification, data model analysis, implementation validation, testing, data integrity, communication, and recommendations.

---

## 1. Clarify Business Requirements
- Meet with stakeholders to define CRUD operations for each entity (e.g., warehouses, shipments).
- Document business rules (e.g., deletion constraints, required fields).
- **Best Practice:** Use collaborative documentation tools to ensure requirements are clear and versioned.
- **Common Tools:** Confluence, Google Docs

## 2. Analyze and Document Data Model
- Review models.py for entity relationships and constraints.
- Create/update ER diagrams and UML diagrams for system architecture.
- **Best Practice:** Visualize relationships and constraints early to prevent design flaws.
- **Common Tools:** dbdiagram.io, Lucidchart, draw.io, Visual Paradigm

## 3. Validate Implementation Against Requirements
- Review CRUD code for alignment with business logic and error handling.
- Ensure business rules are enforced in code.
- **Best Practice:** Use code review and static analysis tools to maintain code quality.
- **Common Tools:** GitHub PRs, VS Code, flake8, pylint

## 4. Test Functionality
- Run automated tests (pytest) and review results.
- Ensure tests cover positive and negative scenarios.
- **Best Practice:** Maintain a comprehensive test suite and automate regression testing.
- **Common Tools:** pytest, SQL CLI, TestRail, Jira (for UAT tracking)

## 5. Ensure Data Integrity
- Check foreign key constraints and cascading rules.
- Prevent orphaned data and handle integrity errors.
- **Best Practice:** Use database modeling and inspection tools to verify schema integrity.
- **Common Tools:** SQL CLI, SQLAlchemy, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver

## 6. Communicate and Document Findings
- Summarize issues, fixes, and recommendations for the team.
- Update README.md and copilot-instructions.md as needed.
- **Best Practice:** Keep documentation up to date and accessible to all stakeholders.
- **Common Tools:** README.md, copilot-instructions.md, Jira, Trello, Confluence

## 7. Recommend and Oversee Fixes
- Work with developers to resolve issues (e.g., missing columns, constraint errors).
- Ensure fixes are tested and documented.
- **Best Practice:** Use migration tools for database changes and track fixes in project management systems.
- **Common Tools:** Alembic, SQL CLI, Jira, Trello

## Example Workflow
1. Gather requirements for CRUD operations.
2. Review models.py and database schema.
3. Run pytest to identify failing tests.
4. Use SQL CLI to inspect and fix schema issues.
5. Update documentation and communicate changes.
6. Verify fixes by re-running tests and checking data integrity.

## Key Best Practices
- Align technical changes with business needs and document every change.
- Use visual modeling tools for UML/BPMN to clarify system and process design.
- Maintain automated and manual test coverage, including UAT.
- Use migration tools for safe database changes.
- Communicate clearly and regularly with all stakeholders.
- Track issues and fixes in project management tools.
- Keep all documentation versioned and accessible.
