# Technical Business Analyst (TBA) Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for Technical Business Analysts working on the logistics management project. It covers requirements clarification, data model analysis, implementation validation, testing, data integrity, communication, and recommendations.

---

## 1. Clarify Business Requirements
- Meet with stakeholders to define CRUD operations for each entity (e.g., warehouses, shipments).
- Document business rules (e.g., deletion constraints, required fields).
- Tools: Confluence, Google Docs

## 2. Analyze and Document Data Model
- Review models.py for entity relationships and constraints.
- Create/update ER diagrams.
- Tools: dbdiagram.io, Lucidchart, SQLAlchemy inspection

## 3. Validate Implementation Against Requirements
- Review CRUD code for alignment with business logic and error handling.
- Ensure business rules are enforced in code.
- Tools: GitHub PRs, VS Code, flake8, pylint

## 4. Test Functionality
- Run automated tests (pytest) and review results.
- Ensure tests cover positive and negative scenarios.
- Tools: pytest, SQL CLI

## 5. Ensure Data Integrity
- Check foreign key constraints and cascading rules.
- Prevent orphaned data and handle integrity errors.
- Tools: SQL CLI, SQLAlchemy, MySQL Workbench

## 6. Communicate and Document Findings
- Summarize issues, fixes, and recommendations for the team.
- Update README.md and copilot-instructions.md as needed.
- Tools: README.md, copilot-instructions.md, Jira, Trello

## 7. Recommend and Oversee Fixes
- Work with developers to resolve issues (e.g., missing columns, constraint errors).
- Ensure fixes are tested and documented.
- Tools: Alembic, SQL CLI, code changes

---

## Example Workflow
1. Gather requirements for CRUD operations.
2. Review models.py and database schema.
3. Run pytest to identify failing tests.
4. Use SQL CLI to inspect and fix schema issues.
5. Update documentation and communicate changes.
6. Verify fixes by re-running tests and checking data integrity.

## Key Reminders
- Align technical changes with business needs.
- Document every change and decision.
- Use automated tests to validate fixes.
- Communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
